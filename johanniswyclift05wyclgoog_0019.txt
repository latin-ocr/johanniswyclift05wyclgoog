it makes him respected from another point os view. Hc begins by
enumerating different kinds of number (pp. 48—50), and for some he
denies the possibility of ascribing them to a universal taken with its
singular. If, however, number be taken to mean all that can be counted,
then he admits that the Universal and its singular can be counted toge-
ther, as the Godhead and the Three Persons of the Trinity. Such is
the sense, if I mistake not, of the words “tunc concedendum est. . .
quod quaelibet unitas quae est essentia substantiae singularis est trinitas
suppositorum ejusdem substantiae . . . . et sic [ut] homo communis differt
ab homine singulari( ita essentia communis differt a personis non sic
communibuff’ (p. 50, l. 20—28).¹ Here the mystery of the Holy Trinity
stands Wyclif in good stead. While he takes care to point out the difference
between the Godhead, as communicable to the PersonS‚ and the Uni-
versal‚ as applicable to its singularS, he says: The numerical difficulty
which you propose to me applies equally to the Divine Essence‚ counted
with the Persons3 qui nimis probat nihil probat'’. This would elude the
difficulty3 but Wyclif is not satisfied with that. Reverting to the above-
mentioned case of the Phoenix, he affirms that the universal and the
singular phoenix are not two, but one (p. 51, l. 16) ; sor there are neither
two universals, nor two singulars (l. 20—22). You cannot say they,
pointing to both at once (l. 30). The universal Phoenix is in no wise
other than (aliud vel alia quam, l. 27, 28) its singular, though they differ
notionally (secundum rationem l. 29). This seems clear enough. Yet if
the universal Phoenix is so identical with its singular that there is a mere
logical distinction between them, and that we cannot even say ‘between
them* properly, can we continue to affirm that it possesses a distinct
reality other than that of its singular? We can, answers Wyclif (⁶⁶. . . duo
distincta realiter‚'' p. 54, l. 10). Every universal and its singular are two
things, really different from each other. This looks very like a contra-
diction in termS‚ unless (which is also possible) the text is corrupt. But
I do not think so, on account of Wyclif’s sudden conclusion of the
debate immediately after these wordS, his avowal that the difficulty is
very great (l. 11, 12) and his pointing out two other ways of answering

¹ The text is slightly changed here from what it is in the treatise. I confess
I understood it less at the time. Even now it is not quite clear, and some words
are probably wanting.
