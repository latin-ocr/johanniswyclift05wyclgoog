X Δ INTRODUCTION.

To put their attack into somewhat more modern language than
the crabbed form 01 1116 text: If you say, “Socrates is an animal and
it is an aSS‚'' you mean that the universal “Animal'' is replaced by it.
But suppose you substitute vertebrate for animal; the sense 01 it is at
once altered. Substitute mammal,· the sense varies again. Thus we have
311 endless series 01 different significations given to it, each 01 1116111 111016
concrete, yet none ever reaching the ultimate limit 01 individuality. This
would be the ruin 01 311 science; 101 we could never draw any inference
from the universal to its singulars; and between each 01 111656 it's there
could be found or imagined room for an infinite multitude of others, These
constantly changing significationis would destroy the possibility 01 deduction.
«A is an animal; it (not A, but the animal) is 3 vertebrate; it (the vertebrate)
is a mammal’' — and 50 on. We can never conclude that A is this singular
individual man (p. 27, l. 20—37). Wyclif answers (pp. 28—30) that,
though less universal as a predicate than its antecedent, it 1135 35 3
subject the power 01 standing for the same, and consequently 101 311 1116
singulars which that antecedent representS. There is indeed an endless
descent, because there is an infinite distance between any universal and
its singularS. But, when we get to the lowest species of all, we have
only accidents, that is, non-essential differences, by which the singulars
are distinguished; so that makes no difficulty. If we say that one uni-
versal is infinitely beyond another, because it extends to more singularS,
this does not mean that it is infinite, any more than a surface, infinitely
greater than a line, would be infinite.

Beaten off on one side (as we may perhaps be allowed to suppose)
the Nominalists return to the charge on another. “You say that Ite does
not stand 101 311 individual. Let us then suppose that two men, Socrates
and Plato, are running„ The proposition, “Somebody runS‚²' willxbe
true; but at the same time it will be true to add: e‘Socrates is not he,
and Plato is not lte,'' Now, what if no one else in the world is running
at the time? (p. 27, l. 37 to end; p. 28, l. 1—12). This however is met
(p. 30, 31) by denying that ‘lte' has here the meaning 01 3 universal
man. It is clearly a singular, meaning the somebody who runs in both
caseS, and in one 01 1116 two it could not but be false.

T lie third argument is aimed more directly against universaIS. Each
01 1116111 stands for all its singular-S. But he, according 10 1116 supposition‚
is a universal. We may say ofA, He is a king; and of Β, He is a thies.
