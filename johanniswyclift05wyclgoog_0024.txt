separately. Four is even; four is three and one; three is odd: therefore
four may truly be said in two different senses to be both even and odd.
Christ is indivisible as God, and divisible, as man (p. 78, l. 35 to
p. 79, l. 22). All this is explained at what I cannot help thinking need· ·
less length3 but it is also quite admissible that a teacher may be trusted
to have known the requirements of his pupils and the exigencies of his
times somewhat better than those who read or edit his works five hundred
years after his death.

2. Then comes the second question: Whether God is able to
create the greatest possible number of creatureS. The three difficulties
>raised at the beginning of the chapter are answered thus; for if God
cannot create this greatest number, the conclusions given there are in-
evitable3 whereas if (as Wyclif maintains) He can, then they are worth-
less (p. 79, l. 22—20). We are, however, not very well qualified to
decide whether this is 3 logical inference‚ and must take. the assertion
for granted, most of these difficulties being stated in a very unintelligible
form. Perhaps the third (p. 73, l. 10—12) alone is not totally obscure:
“Omnia quae Deus potuit facere possunt'esse DeuS, vel nihil potest
differre ab ahoe* This is itself not very clear; but if I can discern a
glimmer of meaning in it, it somewhat resembles the problem still in
vogue amongst Neo-Scholastics: e‘Whether the most perfect creature
possible is possible.'' If there is no limit to the number of creatures
which God can produce, there is either no limit to their perfection, and
one of the infinite multitude is infinitely perfect, though a creature; or.
we must deny any difference of perfection between them. I give this,
however, merely as a hint, not being sure that it is the very same
question to which Wyclif alludes: “Omnia . . . possunt esse DeuS,³'
stands in the way.

The adversary is supposed to deny that any greatest number of
all is possible3 sor it would be infinite3 and that is no less absurd than
a being of infinite size. To create it would exhaust the whole of God's
power, which is inexhaustible. At the Resurrection there would be no
room for an infinite number of men come to life again. Not one man
more could possibly be created or perish. This, t00, would lead to a
denial of Free-will. BesideS‚ if the term man, for instance, is a Universal,
its signification cannot be exhausted, however, great the number of its
singulars may be; it may always be supposed capable of having as
