anybody else. A, meeting B who is a slave, is free that very instant;
therefore B is also free, meeting a free man; therefore A is also a slave.
And so on. Δ

Debates on such questions have practically been dead for many
centuries; they are considered as mere useless subtletieS. And to speak
quite frankly on this matter, they really seem ridiculous enough, even to

a man pretty well versed in scholastic lore. But the greater the tempt- ¹

ation sor men of culture to endorse the sweeping judgments os that
proverbially narrow-minded individual — the man in the street -— the
more they ought to strive against it. They well know that most of the
present philosophical debates‚ though not apparently now so ridiculouS,
because fashionable, will appear so in the course of a few hundred
years· All that we can say of them with certitude is that they serve to
sharpen the wits by going as deep down into the principles of things
and the laws of thought as it is possible to go, If these old world dis-
cussions then served the same purpose, they are worth studying at least
from a historical point of view. And at any rate, the reader will per-
haps feel some interest in the solution to these puzzleS, given from what
Ishould conceive to be the *modern standpoint. Isay, I should conceive,·
for I have been able to find nothing directly referring to them in any
modern work of Logic', not even in the Neo-Scholastic text books of
Liberatore and T ongiorgi, nor in that of the Thomist Goudin wh0, in
the 17th century, argued with overwhelming violence to prove the im·
mobility of the earth.

We should, Ifancy, make but short work os all such propositionS.
The main point of the difficulty is that every proposition must be either
true or false; the subject affirming of the predicate either the thing that
is or the thing that is not. Now, taking any one of these propositionS,
we are compelled by overpowering evidence to admit that it is impos-
sible to call them either true or false. Well then, what follows? Why,
that they are not propositions!¹ They are mere strings of unmeaning

¹ Α Scholastic friend to whom Ι showed this said to me: “What would you
answer to What is written here is a proposition? It could be admitted without
danger; and if you say that it is not, then by affirming its contrary, you admit that
it has meaning.'' This was subtle. Ι answered that it could be admitted without
danger, but that, belonging to the same class os sentenceS‚ it had logically to be
not denied‚ but set aside. It chauces that by thus ignoring, Ι apparently denied it3
