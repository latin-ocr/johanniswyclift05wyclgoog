INTRODUCTION. XIX

it not in your mind, nay, that you positively exclude it from your mind,
is an altogether irrelevant fact (p. 64).” If 1 may be allowed to clear up
the meaning of this by an example, we may suppose that one man pro-
mises to give another a piece of land in which he is convinced that
there are no mineral riches whatever. Now it so happens that he is
mistaken: does the fact of his belief render it untrue that, in promising
the land, he has promised all its mineral riches? When you say: Ipro-
mise apenny - a singular one —- you surely promise all that is con-
tained in that penny: now we say that a Universal is contained therein,
and that, willing or unwilling, you promise it. -- Here Wyclif, in, con-
nection with the indefinite universal term, a penny, makes some remarks
by the way about terms of the first and second intention and imposition
respectively. If a singular penny is spoken of, the sense, primarily uni-
versal, is contracted by the term singular. The promising verb indicates
universality, and that is promised in any case. For instance, I have two
pennieS, and promise you one of the two, That means neither in parti-
culam and it follows that the object of any promise must be universal
<pn 64› 67)-

3. A third difficulty, made up of several put together, runs thus:
Transcendental Being is identical with everything, and at the same time
with anything in the world: if I promise something, it follows that every-
thing has been promised! And yet such a promise comes to nothing in
reality. Ibuy a man; if the meaning of this be eUniversal Man’, then it
includes myself; yet I surely cannot buy my own person. And it might
beisproved in the same way that what is promised is not promised
(p. 62, 1. 5—15).

All this is mere sophistry. The promise of Something is valid; but
the veryjsmallest thing given fulfils it, and so it happens to be an idle
one, legally speaking; but that is not because its object is universal.
There are many such cases which judges would put out of court as fri-
volousCNotice, however, that when the singulars of any universal are of
equal value, any one of them will do; when their valnes differ, we may
not choose at will any one of the worst, but may be compelled by law
to'give one of average worth. (Ι suspect that Wyclif's opponents might
have found means to cavil here. You promise a horse; you give ahack
only fit to be slaughtered3 but you have given the eUniversal horse’ with

it just as well as if you had given a Derby favourite. Why should the
