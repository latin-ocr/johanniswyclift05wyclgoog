way identical between the man A and the man Β in their several natureS.

· Is there any midcourse between this doctrine and that of such Realists

as affirm that there is in man a humanity corresponding to our idea,
and really identical in all its singulars? There is; it is the theory of
Moderate RealistS. To ascribe the universality of our ideas to a mere
groundless fiction of the mind would destroy the objective value of all
reasoning. To suppose that there exists a mysterious something, substan-
tially identical in each and all of the singular objects that come under a
general name, would land us in endless difficulties, with which we shall
soon see Wyclif attempting to grapple. They therefore draw a sharp
distinction between the Universal, as not seen by the mind, and as seen.
The Universal, as formally existing in many singularS, is nowhere but in
the mind. Everything that exists in nature is formally concrete, and sin-
gular in its essence. Thus the Universal, as known, is nothing but a
mere abstraction. But, as able to be known, ,it is otherwise ; it is real;
in each singular it exists as a basis from which our mind is able to
abstract the universal idea. Their definition says of the Universal (as
known) that it exists formaliter in mente, fundamentaliter in re. They
avoid defending a position which they consider unsafe‚ and take up one
which it is very difficult to attack with any chance of success, Asked by
Nominalists if the redness of the rose, the geranium, and the cherry, is
a real universal, they reply: Its reality is formally in the objects, funda-
mentally in the mind; its universality is formally in the mind, fundamen-
tally in the objectS. Asked by those of Wyclif’s school if there is nothing
identical in two shades of colour in which there is no difference, they
answer: Nothing but the aptitude they have for being grasped in one
idea; that aptitude, in objects similarly coloured, really exists; and when
our mind thus grasps them, it becomes actual —- but only in the mind.
This may seem obscure, but Ι can find no words to state it more
clearly: and indeed this seems to me the true solution of the whole
problem. Ι (10 not see what the most determined Nominalist could find
to attack in this reply, if he understood it properly. It might perhaps
not satisfy him; for it keeps up a strict relation between signS, ideaS,
and thingS, between the subjective and the objective order, and maintains
the validity of human reason without restrictions, in whatever sphere il
may work. But it avoids with the utmost care giving a handle to this

most embarrassing objection: How can anything be real and yet not
