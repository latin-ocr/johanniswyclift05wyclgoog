XX INTRODUCTION.

judge enforce an average value, when the value is totally irrelevant to
the thing ‘principally given’? But this is by the way.) — Some promises
may be legally binding, but impossible to fulfil, and not binding in con-
science. — We may go to market intending to buy something there;
now some of our own goods being in the market, it follows that we
intend to buy our own goodS. There is nothing absurd in all this,
unless we go with the explicit intention to buy what we know to be

our own (pp. 67—69). But what absurdity, if a Universal be really .
nothing, for a Nominalist to express himself grateful to a benefactor
who promises him a horse, a saddle‚ &a (p. 69, l. 39 to p. 70, l. 11).

As to· the last quibble: “I will give the (singular) penny which I
do not promise to give (since I promise the Universal).” Such a pro-
mise is a falsehood, for by its very tenour it flatly contradicts itself.
Or we may understand the words to mean: that I do not promise to
give as a singular: but then the sentence has no difficulty (p. 70, l. 12
to p. 71, l. 35).

The chapter closes with a few observations about obligatory actS,
mortal sins incurred by their omission, works of supererogation‚ and
fasting.

Chapter IV. Here Wyclif discusses four difficulties raised, the first
separately, as one of the ordinary objections against Universals; the
other three together, as raising the question of the greatest number
of things possible. There are consequently two distinct parts in this
chapter.

1. Given four propositionS, a, b, c and d (b contradicting a, and
c, d) we find that α and c, and that b and d can coexist respectively;
but that the couples a b, cd cannot. It follows that the four propositionS,
if thought of as coexisting, are at the same time incompatible and com-
patible with one another. On the same lines we may prove that all men
are equal and unequal, friends and enemies, &a (p. 73, l. 15 to p. 75,
l. 7). But Wyclif easily points out that though such contradictory qua-
lities really exist, they exist relatively to· different objects, not to the
same; which makes short of the whole objection. They are indeed all
contradictory and compatible; but not all with all; a, compatible with c
and d, is contradictory to ὸ,- and vice rersd (pp. 75—78). And we come
to the conclusion that opposite qualities, though they cannot be predi-
cated of individuals, may be ascribed to universalS, either essentially‚ or
