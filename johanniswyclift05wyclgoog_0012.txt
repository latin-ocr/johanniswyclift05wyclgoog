INTRODUCTION. IX

latter hals is the same as one of the former, may have the latter term
replaced by a pronoun. As, A is Β and B is C, or A is Β and A is C,
may be rendered: A is Β and it (meaning either A or B) is C. This is
the slight link by which the controversy is connected with the subject
of the chapter; and here comes the tug of war between Universalists
and Nominalists· Wyclif urges that if we say, “A certain man has stolen
something, and he is a thief‚³’ we may very well be ignorant os the
particular he who has committed the theft. He therefore does not stand,
as Nominalists would have it, for the individual himself, but for the
Universal “A certain man who has stolen this or that2’. Nominalists say
they know this disjunctively: it is either A or B or C, &a But this is
an idle quibble: to know thus disjunctively is not to know (p. 26, l. 31
to end; p. 27, l. 1 to 20). “

Now all this looks to modern readers —— and since they are modern,
they must os course be in the right — very much like mere loss of time
and trouble; useless expenditure of braia-work. To the Oxford wranglers
of those days, on the contrary, it must have been full of actuality and
interest: for it was the very central point round which the battle raged,
and VVyclif’s unerring acumen, in thus coming to the point at once, is
greatly to be admired‚ if we can for an instant forget our superiority as
“moderns’'. The Nominalists ssatly denied the existence of anything but
the concrete. For them, a universal name was in itself a* mere “ssatus
vocis’',· according to Ockam's famous expression; it had no meaning
except when applied to its singularS. They therefore could not possibly
admit that the pronoun lte (or indeed any pronoun; who or which, for
instance) stood for a universal Thing, nor even merely for the words
which it replaced (which would still give universality of a certain kind).
It had to stand for a singular object, an individua! man or being. “But
then,’' said the UniversalistS, eeif it stands for only one individual, you
must know who he is, when you say, He is a thies, as usual in such
sentences, If you do not know, and deny that it stands for somebody
in general, the sentence becomes a jumble of words‘, without any mean-
ing’'. We are not here concerned in the Nominalist's reply, which must ν
have been rather shufssing and embarrassed‚ at least for those of the
extreme school of Ockam. But their ,attack upon Wyclif's position, and
the staunch courage with which he stands up to defend it, is very

noteworthy.
