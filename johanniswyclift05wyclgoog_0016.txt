INTRODUCTION. XIII

concrete? Such caution Wyclif thought excessive; it now remains sor us
to see how he fought —- most courageously and skilfully, it must 136
acknowledged -- against this objection in its various forms.

Faithful to his accustomed method of showing a bold front to diffi-
cultieS, and never shirking them, however weighty they may be, he at
vonce proceeds to enquire, 1St How we can distinguish Universals from
their singularS, and from each other; 2nd How the transcendent entity,
Being, is common both to God and to His creatures; 3rd Whether a Uni-
versal can receive accidental attributes, and 41¹¹ Whether a Universal,
taken together with its singularS, makes up a number.

First. Every Universal is all· its singulars, and each of them. It
would seem that if so, it cannot be distinguished from them, nor from
any other Universal that might happen to be those singulars too (p. 34,
end). We are free to deny· that the Universal is its singulars; it is in
them, but is not they, having no personal supposition‚ as they have. But
it is preferable to admit that it is its singularS, and, thus considered,
receives a different personal supposition in each. This supposition‚ which
it has in its singulars and not by itself‚ is amply sufficient to differentiate
it from them (p. 35). In some cases this difference may be merely logical
or notional, but still it suffices for a distinction; as that between the one
universal Phoenix and the one phoenix existing 111 1116 physical world.
Each is identical with the other in all but the fact that the universal
Phoenix is (at least successively) communicable to many, whilst the cor-
poreal phoenix is not. Thus, as we see, even in this test case, there
always remains, between the Universal and its singular, one difference,
— communicability (p. 37).

Second. If God is Being, and the creature is a being, and Being
is a universal reality, the same in both: then we come to the Pantheistic

1 conclusion that there is something common to God and His creatureS,

and really identical in both (pp. 37, 38). And in fact, as the Nomina-
listic position logically ends in Materialism, so Realism -- 11111633 11

*¹ carefully steers the middle course which has been mentioned — neces-

1 sarily tends towards (though not necessarily goes to) the extremes of

κ. Ρ311111613111. To answer the objection, we must note that transcendent

1 being is not in God and in the creature as a difference3 — for instance,
in the way that rationality exists in all men —- but as a mode. This mode
is one in itself; but it exists in God otherwise than in the creature.
