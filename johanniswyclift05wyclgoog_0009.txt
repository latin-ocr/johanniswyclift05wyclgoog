much more stress upon their philological interest than upon their doctrinal
meaning. I have, therefore, thought that 3 full exposition of Wyclif’ 3 ideas
as set forth in this work might prepare the way for a better understand-
ing of the other treatises.

It is perhaps superfluous to add — but in such cases I prefer
saying too much to saying too little -— that I must here repeat the
thanks I gave to Mr. Matthew in the first volume of Logica. Even in so
special and technical a subject as this, his general knowledge of Wyclif’s
views and style has been of much assistance in the understanding of the text.

Chapter I (pp. 1—23). Wyclif begins by a general discussion of
hypothetical propositions. They form seven specieS‚ according as two
or more propositions are joined by the word and (copulatives), or
(disjunctives)‚ if (conditionals), because (causals)‚ more than (comparatives),
where (locals) or when (temporals). These, as Wyclif affirms‚ comprise
all other species; for all, however complex, are reducible to these, and
they spring from the essential relations between God and the creature.
God is, and the creature is; either God is, or created being is not;
the creatures are because God is; God exists more than the creature
exists; God creates beings is] when, and where He chooseS. These pri-
mordial truthS‚ seven and only seven in number, are the archetypes of
all hypothetical propositions (pp. 1—2).

This classification is to some extent arbitrary‚ it is true, but
founded on the nature of thingS. It is not denied that these propositions
might be set in another order, or deduced from the primordial truths in
another way3 but the order given here is the best, because it corres-
ponds best to the order of the universe (p. 3, l. 35 to end; p. 4, l. 1—5).
The words and, ιγ, ete., are neither sufficient to establish the order here
given, nor to classify the propositions (p. 4, l. 5—12). If it be objected
that many hypothetical 'propositions are false, and that consequently
truth‚ and particularly primordial truth‚ has nothing to do with their
classification (p. 2. l. 20—35), Wyclif points out that every proposition
must be true at least in a transcendental sense. If it means something
salse, it means a thing that is not, and therefore is true — negatively
(pp. 4,. 5). His classisication depends properly, not only on those signs
which render the propositions hypothetical‚ nor on the truth or salsity
of the latter, but upon the peculiar sense given by those words to the
propositions which they unite into one whole (p 6, l. 30 to end).
