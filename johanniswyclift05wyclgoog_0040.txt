shorter time (C‘) a smaller power, A‘, would be able to bear this same
weight Β; 11113, 111 1116 ορ1111011 of the adversarieS‚ would prove that no
power has 3 special maximum of its own (p. 138, 1. 38 10 p. 139, l. 9).
Wyclif answers here at great length (pp. 152- 162), giving many diffe-
rent senses os the word ‘difficulty'; but we need not go into them. The
gist of his reply (p. 159, 1. 4—10) is that the notion of a maximum
must here be considered with regard to the time, and not apart. We
may, however, in this long and discursive reply, note several striking
sentenceS, some paradoxical, some quaint, and some proving a con-
siderable knowledge of mechaniCS, as then known. “Of all difficult
things — i. e. of those which deteriorale the agent that does them -ε
mortal sin is the most difficult (p. 155, l. 26, 27).'' “In the sense of
‘something to be mastered’, the universe is a difficulty to God Himself
(p. 156, l. 20—25).'’ “Withont God's aid we should find it as difficult
to move a bean as to make 3 world (p. 157, l. 29—31).³' “In the act
of sustaining, much depends on the manner of application of the weight,
An egg will not be crushed even by a considerable force; a sail will
bear up against a strong wind; and experiments with levers prove this
abundantly and in a marvellous way (multa . . . mirabilia facere, p. 160,
1. 25-34).” ε(Τ116 least weight a man cannot sustain is the greatest
that he can (p. 160, 1. 34—37).³’ “Weight implies distance from the
centre‚ or from the proper sphere of each element; water in its own
sphere has no weight, 33 divers tell 113, and Ι suppose that it is the
same for the earth too (p. 161, l. 14—16).”

4. The biggest or the smallest man possible is impossible. If the
sorrner got a bump (tunsionem), he would then be too big to exist. If
„the latter lost 3 11311· (quamlibet ablationem partis superfluae), he would
be too small. —- This humorous argument is answered on p. 167
(l. 34 & seq.) where it is pointed ont that, though the greatest possible
giant could not assimilate any more food, so long as his body remained
of that size, a swelling would not render his organism, as a living body,
any the larger. And a similar train os reasoning would apply to the
smallest dwarf. But before'this reply, we come to a very interesting
digression (pp. 162—166). Wyclis, admitting a minimum of size for all
bodily substanceS‚ implicitly asserts the existence of atoms from the very
ontset (minima naturalia; p. 162, l. 11); and a few pages later, he openly
gives them their right name (athomo‘rum p. 166, l. 32). It is too ge-
