become to increase our knowledge. Nor can there be any limit to the
raising of a pile indefinitely high (p. 139, l. 19—30). — All this is
absolutely denied. We know by saith that the Saints in Heaven do really
attain their maximum limit os possible knowledge by means of the
beatific vision of God. The question how this can be — a favour-ite one
both with Mediaeval and with modern Scholastics *— is discussed at
some length. The blessed are not infinitely more perfect than we; for
their knowledge is an accidental privilege, not an essential attribute.
Wyclif inclines to think that they see all things in God; but, however
this may be, the essence of felicity consists in the sight of God Himsels3
even were they ignorant os something, they would none the less be
persectly happy (p. 168, l. ιο to p. 174, l. 18). As to the raising os a
pile indefinitely high, os course the higher it went, the more difficult it
would be to raise it any further; and there would come a point at
which it would exhaust all the powers of the whole human race to get
even one more stone to the summit. Thus, Nature imposes a limit to
men in all things; excessive increase os anything, for instance, of
Church ceremonies and possessions, is hurtful. This is a seed which at
'a later period developed into an enormous tree (p. 174, l. 33 to
p. 175, l. 22). ’

6. A minimum os visibility is absurd. Seeing a surface, we see
the whole of it, and therefore weconfusedly see all its parts, even to
the infinitely small. —- But Wyclif posits as an evident principle that
whatever is seen confusedly might, under other circumstanceS, be dis-
tinctly seen. This takes all the force out of the objection. A mathe-
matical point cannot be seen distinctly under any circumstances; for the
smallest thing visible must bc the base of a pyramid having its apex in
the eye. The chapter comes to a close with some details on the struc-
ture and organism of the eye, which may be curious as representing
the state of optical science in those days; but I am not in a position
to discuss them thoroughly; scarcely at all. As Wyclif avowedly takes
most of what he says from the works, not only of Alhazen‚ but also of the
famous Vitellio (Ciolek) of Cracow, one of the most celebrated opticians
in the Middle AgeS, I should have liked to compare his anatomical
description with the summary given by our author. Unfortunately, the
work in question was not in the Jagellonian Library when Ι asked for
it, having been lent out at some distance from Cra'cow; but the English
