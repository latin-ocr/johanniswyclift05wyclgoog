XXVI INTRODUCTION.

se or per accidenS, a true cause or a mere occasion. We may pass over
these details rapidly, only noting the conclusion: that the material exists
for the formal cause, this latter for the efficient, and the efficient for the
final cause. The ultimate End of all beings is that toward which all
beings tend, and for which they all exist, whilst it exists for itself alone.
Thus itfican have no parts, but must be absolutely simple in its essence;
for if it had partS, every one would be caused, and would exist only
for the whole. Tw‘o beings may cause one another in different lines of
causation, but not in the same (pp. 92—96).

’ Every causal proposition is reduplicative. For instance: Yon move,
since you walk, means Inasmuch as you walle, you move. Therefore,
though other propositions are also reduplicative (asz The more alike
two things are, the less they differ), Wyclif takes the present occasion
to investigate the nature of reduplicativeS, and continues his investigation
in the following chapter. Whenever such a proposition is reducible to a
causal one, the predicate must be universal. If, for instance, Every man,
qua man, is rational, then it also follows that Every rational being is a
man. This is not always the case when the proposition cannot thus be
reduced (pp. 96-98 to l. 6)..

-Here comes a difficulty. Suppose we say: A man, in so far as he
is white, 'does not build: is this true, and may we consider that ‘white-
ness’ is not a cause of his building? Some assert that we may not3 sor
the whole man builds, and whiteness is an attribute of the whole man.
Wyclif, on the contrary, thinks that the proposition is true. The con-
nection between this apparently useless and meaningless subtlety and the
profound mysteries of the Scholastic doctrine concerning the ehypostasis',
or essence of individuality, becomes clearer, when we ask, Did Christ,
qua God, suffer'and die? Did He„ qua man, create the world? The
answer given is in strict accordance with orthodoxy (p. 98, l. 6 to
Ρ· 99⁹ l· 4)·

This leads us to examine what such modes of being as white-
neSS, &c., added to the substance, are in themselves· Real they are no
doubt, according to the general drift of Wyclif's opinions; but are they
realities distinct from the substance to which they belong and which
they modify? If so, every substance would, in each of its modificationS,
differ from itself. But the difference is merely modal, not substantia13
only the modes differ: to be thus or otherwise, and to be existing, are
